- Use the button above to deploy the project to Vercel. Vercel will automatically fork and clone the project to your GitHub account.
- Define environment variables inside Vercel: `REFRESH_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Finally, change configuration file [`config/api.json`](config/api.json) and [`config/site.json`](config/site.json) according to your configs.

The authentication tokens and variables are the same as what you configured in the [`onedrive-cf-index`](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-cf-index) project. Detailed documentations can also be found there (for now). This project is at its early stages, for discussions *please, please, please* post to the [discussion forum](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-vercel-index/discussions).
